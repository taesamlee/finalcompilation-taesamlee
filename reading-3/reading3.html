      <h1>Reading Response 3: "My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?"</h1>
      <p>A website is a:
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
        <li>a file or bundle of files</li>
        <li>an individual act of collective ambition</li>
        <li>a room</li>
        <li>a shelf</li>
        <li>a plant</li>
        <li>a garden</li>
        <li>a puddle</li>
        <li>a thrown rock thatâ€™s now falling deep into the ocean</li>
      </ul>
</p>
<p>Currently, for me a website is more like a Phoenix every year it seems to die and come alive in a completely different form. Each year I gain new skills that allow me to make my portfolio look more professional. I have moved from Wix to Squarespace to Adobe Portfolios, and finally to Webflow. But who knows maybe I'll soon move to code my entire portfolio. I wish that in the future I can settle to one form of building and storing content and my website becomes a plant.</p>
